  - File comparison
  - Real-time file watching
- Added syntax highlighting support for multiple languages
- Implemented CI/CD pipeline monitoring
- Added version control operations

### 2. Frontend Development
- Created TicketList component with:
  - Filtering capabilities
  - Status indicators
  - Priority levels
  - Type categorization
- Implemented TicketDetail component with:
  - Real-time agent interactions
  - Code change visualization
  - Approval workflow
  - Message history
- Added FileBrowser component with:
  - Tree view navigation
  - File operations
  - Syntax highlighting
- Implemented Dashboard component to combine all features

### 3. Backend Development
- Implemented FastAPI routers for:
  - File operations
  - Ticket management
  - Agent interactions
- Added WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Implemented file watching system
- Added file comparison functionality

### 4. Testing and Documentation

- Updated README with project status

## Key Features Implemented

### File Management
- File operations (read, write, delete, copy, move)
- File search with content and name-based options
- File comparison with diff visualization
- Real-time file watching
- Syntax highlighting for multiple languages

### Ticket Management
- Ticket creation and management
- Status tracking
- Priority levels
- Type categorization
- Agent interactions
- Real-time updates

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Pipeline status monitoring
- Build, test, and deploy stages
- Manual trigger support
- Real-time status updates

### Version Control
- Branch management
- Commit operations
- Push and pull functionality
- Change tracking

## Next Steps
1. Complete end-to-end testing
2. Add more language support for syntax highlighting
3. Implement advanced agent capabilities
4. Add analytics dashboard
5. Implement user authentication
6. Add integration with external services

## Notes
- All components are built with TypeScript and React
- Backend is implemented using FastAPI
- Real-time updates are handled via WebSocket
- File operations are performed asynchronously
- Error handling is implemented throughout the application
