# DevAgent - Full-Stack Developer & DevOps AI Agent

## Overview
DevAgent is an autonomous AI assistant designed to help developers by automating various aspects of the software development lifecycle. It can understand tasks from Jira tickets, design solutions, write code, implement tests, handle version control, create pull requests, and assist with deployment.

## Features (In Progress)
- [ ] Task Ingestion & Understanding
- [ ] Solution Design & Planning
- [ ] Code & Test Generation
- [ ] Version Control Integration
- [ ] Pull Request Management
- [ ] Deployment Assistance
- [ ] Post-Deployment Monitoring

## Architecture
DevAgent follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

### Core Components
1. **Ticket Ingestion & Interpretation Engine**
   - Processes Jira tickets and other task inputs
   - Extracts requirements and context

2. **Solution Planning & Strategy Module**
   - Breaks down tasks into actionable steps
   - Designs solution architecture

3. **Code Generation & Refinement Core**
   - Interfaces with Gemini 2.5 API
   - Generates and refines code

4. **Test Generation & Execution Framework**
   - Implements TDD practices
   - Generates and runs tests

5. **Version Control Integration**
   - Manages Git operations
   - Handles branching and commits

6. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
   - Interfaces with deployment systems
   - Manages build and deployment processes

7. **Communication & Notification Module**
   - Handles Slack/Teams integration
   - Manages Jira updates

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **LLM Integration**: Gemini 2.5 API
- **Testing**: pytest
- **Version Control**: Git
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Documentation**: Sphinx
