3. **Code Generation & Refinement Core**
   - Interfaces with Gemini 2.5 API
   - Generates and refines code

4. **Test Generation & Execution Framework**
   - Implements TDD practices
   - Generates and runs tests

5. **Version Control Integration**
   - Manages Git operations
   - Handles branching and commits

6. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
   - Interfaces with deployment systems
   - Manages build and deployment processes

7. **Communication & Notification Module**
   - Handles Slack/Teams integration
   - Manages Jira updates

## Technology Stack

## API Endpoints

### Code Generation
- **POST /code/generate**
    - Request body: `{ "prompt": "Describe the code you want generated" }`
    - Response: `{ "code": "<generated code>" }`
    - Description: Generates code using Gemini 2.5 API based on the provided prompt.

### Test Generation
- **POST /code/generate-tests**
    - Request body: `{ "code": "<code to generate tests for>" }`

## UI Development

- **Next.js Frontend**: A new Next.js project (`devagent-ui`) has been scaffolded and integrated into the Docker Compose setup. It will run on port 3000 and interact with the FastAPI backend.
- **UI Workflow**: The UI will guide developers through the full TDD loop:
  - Code Generation: Submit a prompt to generate code.
  - Test Generation: Submit code to generate tests.
  - Test Execution: Run the generated tests and view results.
  - Troubleshooting: If tests fail, submit code and error details for troubleshooting.
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Display commit history and repository progress.
  - Add interactive feedback and real-time updates.
  - Integrate with version control and CI/CD pipelines.

## Version Control Integration

DevAgent now supports basic git operations with ticket number integration:

- **POST /git/init**: Initialize a git repository.
- **POST /git/branch**: Create a new branch with a custom name.
- **POST /git/branch-with-ticket**: Create a new branch with a ticket number and description (e.g., `ticket-123-feature-name`).
- **POST /git/commit**: Commit changes with a custom message.
- **POST /git/commit-with-ticket**: Commit changes with a ticket number in the message (e.g., `[Ticket #123] Your commit message`).
- **POST /git/push**: Push changes to a remote repository.

### Example Usage

- **Creating a branch with a ticket number:**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/git/branch-with-ticket" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"ticket_number": "123", "description": "feature-name"}'
  ```

- **Committing with a ticket number:**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/git/commit-with-ticket" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"ticket_number": "123", "message": "Implement feature X"}'
  ```
